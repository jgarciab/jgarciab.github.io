machine-learning-social-science:
  title: Machine Learning in Social Science
  story:
  - Social-science theories are often evaluated with a single model specification,
    which makes it hard to compare competing explanations and to identify where theories
    fail.
  - 'This line uses benchmark-style evaluation, prediction gaps, and large administrative/survey
    data to connect prediction to explanation: where model performance diverges, we
    gain substantive clues about hidden mechanisms and subgroup-specific dynamics.'

networks-and-inequality:
  title: Networks, Inequality and Polarization
  story:
  - Why do inequality and polarization persist even when individuals face similar
    formal opportunities? A central hypothesis is that relational structure, not only
    individual traits, shapes outcomes. This line models schools, families, neighborhoods,
    and online ties as interconnected systems, testing how network position, social
    context, and interaction patterns produce unequal trajectories and polarized
    attitudes.
  - In social media settings, this work examines how belief systems, signed ties,
    and information exposure shape polarization, hidden extremes, and possible pathways
    to depolarization.

taxation-and-economic-crime:
  title: Taxation and Economic Crime
  story:
  - Profit shifting, illicit financial flows, and corporate opacity erode public revenue
    and distort competition, with disproportionate consequences for lower-income countries
    and vulnerable groups.
  - This line maps corporate ownership networks and jurisdictional strategies, combining
    firm-level and country-level data to identify where profits are shifted, which
    intermediaries enable it, and where policy intervention can be most effective.
  - It directly extends my PhD research on offshore corporate structures and tax havens,
    and my policy-facing analytics work at the Tax Justice Network.
  grants:
  - name: AMLC Co-funding for PhD on Illicit Financial Flows
    funder: Anti Money Laundering Centre (AMLC)
    period: Ongoing
    role: Co-supervision / research line lead
    description: Supports PhD research (Elena) on illicit financial flows, corporate
      networks, and detection strategies for economic crime.

corporate-networks:
  title: Corporate Power and Networks
  story:
  - Who controls global corporate capital, and through which ownership pathways does
    that control travel across jurisdictions?
  - This line built large-scale maps of corporate ownership and board structures to
    identify concentration, transnational control, and the role of intermediary jurisdictions
    in shaping economic and political power.

stochasticity-genetic-networks:
  title: Stochasticity in Genetic Networks
  story:
  - Genetically similar cells can follow different trajectories, and this microscopic
    stochasticity is central to development, differentiation, and disease.
  - This line combines single-cell sequencing and dynamic modeling to characterize
    how noise, timing, and regulatory interactions shape cell-state transitions across
    developmental processes.
