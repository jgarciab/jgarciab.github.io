  slug: machine-learning-social-science
  status: current
  years: "2024-"
  summary: What can machine-learning models reveal about social processes beyond prediction accuracy alone? This project uses high-dimensional and administrative data to identify where models generalize and where performance gaps point to substantive mechanisms.

  slug: networks-and-inequality
  status: current
  years: "2024-"
  summary: Social and institutional ties help structure inequality, mobility, and political polarization. The work combines network topology with behavioral and attitudinal data to trace how divisions emerge and persist over time.

- title: Stochasticity in Genetic Networks
  slug: stochasticity-genetic-networks
  status: previous
  years: "2012-2015"
  summary: Why do genetically identical cells behave differently over time? This work modeled stochastic gene-regulation dynamics to study pulsing, noise propagation, and how microscopic variability scales to population-level outcomes.
